Fontloader - A simple interface for utilising the freetype2 library

Homepage: http://www.psp-programming.com/animate/fontloader/

Version 0.1

  -= Features =-

-- Supports multiple fonts
-- Smooth anti-aliased font appearance
-- Fonts cached for faster access

  -= Installing freetype2 =-

Samstag has posted an excellent guide at http://forums.qj.net/showthread.php?t=47934

Samstag is also the author of 'flib' which is another library for freetype2 development
... and the reason I created Fontloader :)

  -= Samples =-

In the 'Samples' directory within this archive there is example code on how to integrate
Fontloader.

Currently there is only an example using Psilocybeing's graphic library, but I intend to
create examples for GU and possibly even PSPGL.

/Samples/Graphicslib/	-- Psilocybeing's graphic library sample

The sample and the fontloader.h are well commented so implementation should be simple. 

  -= ToDo =-

-- GU Support
-- PSPGL Support
-- Rotation

  -= Credits =-

Samstag		For flib and inspiring me to create this.
Shine		The code in Fontloader is based heavily on the freetype2 implementation in LuaPlayer
		99% of the credit for Fontloader should go to him!
